# Marketing Campaign Analysis and Customer Acquisition Prediction

## Overview
Podha, a growing company, has been running multiple marketing campaigns to acquire new customers. However, due to a crunch in funds, the company has decided to limit its efforts to a single marketing campaign that optimizes budget utilization while maximizing customer acquisition and profitability. Additionally, there is a need to predict customer acquisition based on the available budget.

## Business Understanding
### Stakeholders
1. Company Executives. The results of this project will guide them in making data-driven decisions to maximize ROI and customer acquisition.
2. Marketing Team. The insights will help them focus their efforts on campaigns that generate the highest profitability and customer acquisition rates.

### Business Problem
The company must identify which marketing campaign has brought in the most profitable customers to ensure financial stability and growth. Furthermore, predicting customer acquisition based on budget will help in strategic planning and resource allocation.

Therefore, I aim to:
1. Evaluate the performance of past marketing campaigns.
2. Determine the best acquisition source based on profitability metrics.
3. Predict customer acquisition based on Podha's budget.
4. Provide actionable recommendations supported by data visualization to inform strategic decisions.
